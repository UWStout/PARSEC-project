            <p class="lead">
              PARSEC was originally developed to support scanning experiments at UW Stout both for research and
              for content creation in many different courses on campus. We support research in computer graphics
              and computer vision as well as digital humanities and aim to enrich the curriculum in many programs
              including Game Design and Development, Animation, Professional Communication and Emerging Media,
              Industrial Design, and Fashion Design. It is located on campus in the UW Stout FabLab in room 120 in
              the Vocational Rehabilitation building.
