## Getting started
Welcome to the PARSEC lab info website! This site is under heavy expansion. Presently most pages and info are missing but throughout the Spring of 2023 expect the content to expand. As the equipment has reached full working order we are eager to document all the software and processes that are in use with PARSEC so that more classes and faculty can take advantage of this equipment.

If you are eager to use it now please reach out to the principle researcher on this project, Seth Berrier ([berriers@uwstout.edu](mailto:berriers@uwstout.edu))
