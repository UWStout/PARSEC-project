The PARSEC equipment and software are the results of efforts from many individuals including faculty, staff and student. It has been continually supported by the university with initial equipment funds from the National Science Foundation.

### Dr. Seth Berrier
[Seth](https://www.uwstout.edu/directory/berriers){:target="_blank"} was the sole principle investigator on the original NSF grant that funded acquiring the equipment and assembling it as well as the development of the custom software used to control the equipment. He is the current manager of PARSEC and the primary contact for additional information.

### Masters & Undergraduate Students
During the six years of the equipment grant, students were hired to help with assembly, documentation, software development, and user experience design.  We wish to recognize the following students for their contribution to PARSEC:

### PARSEC Project Support & Acknowledgements
This project was initially funded by a [generous grant from the NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1626116){:target="_blank"} specifically targets to support undergraduate enrichment. We would like to thank the NSF as well as the UW Stout Discovery Center for making room for this equipment in the Fab Lab and Mike King, the manager of the Fab Lab for his support and help on many miscellaneous tasks during the building and operation of PARSEC.

Throughout the installation and configuration of PARSEC we were supported by [ESPER Designs LTD](https://www.esperhq.com/){:target="_blank"} in the UK. PARSEC purchased equipment from ESPER to power and control the cameras in use. The lighting dome was purchased from ESPER as a build-to-order product. ESPER has continued to support us and provide consultation on their equipment. We extend our thanks for their involvement and dedication throughout the many challenges that PARSEC faced over the years.
