PARSEC targets two primary tasks: capture of shape and simple texture, and capture of complex appearance. This page details how to capture shape with simple base texture using the camera rig for an object SMALLER than a human.

### Shape & Texture Capture with PARSEC, Less than Human Scale
Smaller shapes can also be captured with PARSEC, however the default setup is not ideal for anything less than about 4 ft in height and general size.  To capture smaller objects we can modify the space to focus on just one corner of the PARSEC system and utilize a turntable to see all sides of the object.

Below are the recommended steps for capturing smaller objects with PARSEC which should results in a detailed polygon mesh and high-resolution texture.
