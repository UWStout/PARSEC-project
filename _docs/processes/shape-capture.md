PARSEC targets two primary tasks: capture of shape and simple texture, and capture of complex appearance. This page details how to capture shape with simple base texture using the camera rig for a person or something similar in size.

### Shape & Texture Capture with PARSEC, Human Scale
The main equipment of PARSEC is modeled after setups commonly used in the video games industry to capture a character model from an existing person. The person steps into the capture space and many cameras at different angles are fired nearly simultaneously while the area is flooded with bright light. The resulting photographs are processed with commercial software (we recommend Agisoft Metashape) to reconstruct the shape and basic appearance of the person as a polygon mesh with a detailed color texture.

Below are the recommended steps for this process on the PARSEC system which should result in a highly-detailed polygon mesh with a high-resolution texture for the person or object you are scanning.
