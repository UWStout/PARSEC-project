PARSEC targets two primary tasks: capture of shape and simple texture, and capture of complex appearance. This page details how to capture complex appearance characteristics using the ESPER light dome.

### Appearance Capture with PARSEC
Capturing of appearance is not as standardized as well shape and texture capture. There are no off-the-shelf tools to process the photographs captured or generally accepted standard techniques that will work on all cases.  With PARSEC, we are attempting to push further into this area of research and explore ways to capture objects that are difficult to deal with because of their appearance properties.

This will be one of the last areas expanded on this site and the process may never be fully standardized here due to a lack of tools to interpret the data that the ESPER light dome can capture. We will, however, document basic steps to setup and use the light dome and tips for successful data capture as we proceed.
